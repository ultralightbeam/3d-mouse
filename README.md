# 3D Mouse Project

You would move around a conventional mouse on a table to interact with your personal computer. Here we extend a dimension and build a 3D mouse prototype using a standard 6-axis accel-gyro (MPU6050).

## Prototype

- Plotter for raw 3D accel and debug use
- Use 3-axis accel to control 3D, and a shaker for an interaction. Shaker will be based on a low-compute classifier that can run on a MacBook CPU in real-time.
